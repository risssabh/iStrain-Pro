            <h4>Fun Fact</h4>
            <h1>Simpsons Was On Vision<br>Pro Trend Way Before Apple</h1>
            <p><span>The Simpsons has once again demonstrated its uncanny ability to predict the future.</span> this time foreseeing Apple’s latest technological innovation – the Vision Pro virtual reality headset. One of the most recent instances of this peculiar phenomenon occurred in a 2016 episode titled Friends and Family. In this episode, characters were depicted using virtual reality headsets in their daily lives, an image that bears a striking resemblance to  Apple’s recent launch of the  Vision Pro. Sorry Apple but you can't defeat Simpsons, they are way ahead of you.
